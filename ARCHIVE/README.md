## Repository structure 

### Code
- [`code`](code) contains all the python and R code that train TPOT and test recommended pipelines on the QSAR datasets.

### Literature review
- [`existing_performance`](existing_performance) summarizes existing accuracies on the QSAR datasets of previous studies (see [`papers`](papers)).

### Results
- [`code/pipelines`](code/pipelines) and [`code/accuracies`](code/accuracies) save the preliminary results of running TPOT-MLP on the QSAR datasets.
- [`code/predictions`](vpredictions) are predicted outcome on the testing set.
- [`MLP_results`](MLP_results) summarizes the preliminary results.
